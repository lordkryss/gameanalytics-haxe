gameanalytics-haxe
==================

Gameanalytics.com haxe SDK based on [GA-Flash-SDK](https://github.com/GameAnalytics/GA-Flash-SDK)

Currently it's just a port to haxe, i used as3tohaxe with custom corrections where the automated port failed.

I plan to remove every flash.net.* reference to make it truly cross-platform and usable outside openfl (for example in flambe).
